# Machine Learning: Python Vs. Rust Vs. ?

Drafts, tests and projects implementations for the DS/ML course, rust tests and other tools.

## Usage

```shell
nix develop
```

## Python
Using `Python 3.12` as Tensorflow still seems incompatible with 3.13.

## Rust
The `1.91.0-nightly` is being used as some features used are still unstable.

## TODOs

* Try out [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) in python (non need for rust)
